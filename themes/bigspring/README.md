In this tutorial we will show you to make your website live without buying any hosting and touching a single line of code. We made this tutorial based on [meghna hugo](https://github.com/themefisher/meghna-hugo) but you can setup everithing like this.

### What you need !!

1. Git acccount (Ex: Github, Gitlab etc ) . In our case we use github.
2. [Netlify](https://bit.ly/netlify-account) account to host files and add custom domain .
3. [Forestry](https://bit.ly/forestry-account) account to maintain whole project without code.


### Step 1 : Fork or Clone repository

First we will fork this [bigspring](https://github.com/themefisher/bigspring-hugo-startup-theme) template.

### Step 2 : Add your repository in Forestry

Go to your [forestry](https://bit.ly/forestry-account)  account and click on `import your site now`. declare your config.toml file [`exampleSite`] and fill up basic settings .

**Or just click this button for one click installation** [![import to forestry](https://assets.forestry.io/import-to-forestryK.svg)](https://app.forestry.io/quick-start?repo=themefisher/bigspring-hugo-startup-theme&engine=hugo&version=0.60.1&config=exampleSite)

Now mark everything as done, then go to configuration to change the base url . You can put any url but this have to similar as netlify . So for now put a name which you are going to put in netlify as netlify subdomain.

### Step 3 : Setup and host website with Netlify

Here comes the last step . Go to your [netlify](https://bit.ly/netlify-account) account and click add new site . Choose your git repository to import your website in netlify .  And now you can see the forked `bigspring` theme. select it and follow the steps. Then go to `site settings` for change the site name and put your subdoamin name here what you puted on forestry as base url. save it and go to `deploy` from top menu, Wait a while and click on `site preview` or just simply go to the subdomain you puted as base url. **BOOM! Your site is live.** Now you can go to forestry and add, remove or customize every setting and content.
